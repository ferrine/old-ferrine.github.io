The Practical Bayes course was first held at [Moscow State University, Autumn 2022](https://www.econ.msu.ru/students/mag/curricula/eco/andan/news/News.20220802192752_5070/)

This course is aimed at mastering Bayesian methods in practice. Advanced modeling is not about conjugate distributions (although they are sometimes useful), but mostly about projecting knowledge about the problem into code. Successful research will also require skills in solving problems of convergence, parameterization, selection from several models. A course with a focus on programming in Python / PyMC.

## Lecture 1
Introducing Bayesian thinking and practical definitions of the famous Bayes formula

$$
p(\theta|\;\mathcal{D}) = \frac{p(\mathcal{D}|\;\theta)p(\theta)}{p(\mathcal{D})}
$$
