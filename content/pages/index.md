<p> I am a principal data scientist at <a href=https://pymc-labs.io>PyMC Labs</a> where we build open source software and provide consulting services to large companies and small startups. We do top notch Bayesian modelling for challenging causal problems that are not solved with classical fit-predict paradigm.

## Projects

### Neuroscience
Neuroscience backed model to quantify treatment effect on human brain for a *Pharmaceutical company*. Using a Bayesian model it became possible to work on scarce experimental data and quantify brain activity metrics from an interactive game.

### AB Testing
Multiple AB testing projects evolved into a principled way to establish priors, plan the experiment and interpret the results. I've included this knowledge into my [Practical Bayes course](/tag/practical-bayes.html) and gave a [talk](/latex/beamer/talks/ods-ab-testing-17-12-2022/ods-ab-testing-17-12-2022.pdf) at the [ODS workshop](https://ods.ai/events/data-elka-2022).

### Bioengineering
Bioengineering project to understand molecules structure. The main challenge is temporal nature of noisy observations. The model had to infer the [HMM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model) structure from hundreds of noisy time series. Classical machine learning had failed to take in account the structured solution.

### Other
Other projects include marketing mix model, chemistry multilevel models and knowledge transfer between past and current experiments.


## Teaching

I'm an [invited lecturer](https://www.econ.msu.ru/students/mag/curricula/eco/andan/news/News.20220802192752_5070/) at Moscow State University since 2022. Recent updates about the course can be found [here](/tag/practical-bayes.html).

## Experience
* Bayesian deep learning research at [Bayes Group](https://bayesgroup.ru/) 2017-2020
* Large scale computer vision and distributed deep learning for collaborative environments
* Strong Python, Linux and CI/CD experience
